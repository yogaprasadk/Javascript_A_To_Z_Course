/* Arithmetic operators in JavaScript allow us to perform mathematical calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. */

// addition
let sum1 = 5
let sum2 = 6
let sum3 = sum1 + sum2
console.log(sum3)

//subtraction
let sub = 6 - 6
console.log(sub)

// multiplication
let mul = 5 * 6
console.log(mul)

// division
let div = 6/6
console.log(div)

// modulos
let rem = 6%6
console.log(rem)

// exponentitation
/*Exponentiation in JavaScript was introduced in ECMAScript 2016 (ES7)*/

let a = 5
let b = 3
let exp = a**b
console.log(exp)
